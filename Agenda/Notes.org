* TODO Denote VS ORG Roam
I have just started using _Org Roam_ so my notes' network is not big.
_Denote_ is interesting, it's completely indipendent from external software (like SQLite for org roam), with Roam I have already faced difficulty trying to make it work on Windows11 (I didn't spend to much time trying to fix SQLite dependencies), I think that I will have the same problem on my Ipad.
** Org Roam
| Pro                    | Versus             |
|------------------------+--------------------|
| Plain text note (.org) | SQLite dependecies |
| Most widespread        |                    |
| Already configured     |                    |
** Denote
| Pro                                | Versus                                                                     |
|------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| One dependecies Emacs              | Maybe with a big network it will become slow                               |
| Plain text note (.txt, .md, .org)  | Just published, maybe there are bugs                                       |
| Interesting file naming convention | No visualization of the network (I didn't find this feature on the manual) |
