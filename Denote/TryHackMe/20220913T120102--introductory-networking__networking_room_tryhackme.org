* The OSI Model: An Overview
The Open Systems Interconnection Model is a standardised model which is used to demonstrate the theory behind computer networking.
TCP/IP is more compact than the OSI.
The OSI model is a little bit easier to understand in the beginning.
** Structure of the OSI model
1. Physical
2. Data Link
3. Network
4. Transport
5. Session
6. Presentation
7. Application
Here is a mnemonic to remember the layers:
#+begin_quote

** Layer 7 - Application
Provide networking options to programs running on a computer.
Works, almost, exclusively with applications.
Basically it is an iterface to implement, see [[https://medium.com/javarevisited/oop-good-practices-coding-to-the-interface-baea84fd60d3][programmin to an interface]]
When data is given to the application layer, it is passed down into the presentation layer.
** Layer 6 - Presentation
The presentation layer receives data from the application layer.
This data is in a format understandable by the application, but this doesn't mean that it is standardised.
This layer translate this data into a standardised format (and also handle the encryption when requested).
When the data is /translated/ it is sended to the Session layer.
** Layer 5 - Session
When this layer receive data, it looks to see if it can setup a connection with the other computer across the network.
If that isn't possible it sends back an error the layer above.
Otherwise if a session can be _established_ then it's the job of the session layer to maintain it, as well as communicate with the session layer on the other machine.
The session created is unique to the communication betwenn the two computer.
When the connection is established it is transfered to the Transport Layer
** Layer 4 - Transport
The first things to do in the trasport layer is to choose the right protocol to do the job.
The 2 most commonn are:
+ Transmission Control Protocol, the packets are called segments
+ User Datagram Protocol, the packets are called datagram
When a protocol is selected, the data is divided in small piece, namely _segments_ in the TCP and _datagram_ in UDP, and sended to the Network Layer.
** Layer 3 - Network
This layer is responsible for locating the destination of the request.
It is his job to select the _best route_ for the data, once is done the packets are passed to Data Link Layer.
*** Important note
At this level the OSI is working with IP (IPv4/IPv6) address.
** Layer 2 - Data Link
This layer is focused on the physical addressing of the transmission, at this stage it is working with frame, which don't have any information about the IP address (the information is still there but encapsulated).
This layer add the information about the MAC address of the sender associated with the NIC.
It's job of the data link layer to present the data in a format suitable for transmission, as said before, they are called frame.
The last job (surely there are more, but this is an introduction) the Data Link do is check, when receive, if the data is corrupted.
** Layer 1 - Physical
This layer is all about the hardware of the computer.
Here the data is transfered over the networks until it reach his destination.
The data is transmitted in the binary format.

#+end_quote
** Answer 5

#+begin_quote
6
#+end_quote
** Answer 6
Which layer tracks communications between the host and receiving computers?
#+begin_quote
5
#+end_quote
** Answer 7
Which layer accepts communication requests from applications?
#+begin_quote
7
#+end_quote
I strived with this question, but thinking about that it is obvious (I use that word a lot in english) that is the layer 7, for example using [[https://kdeconnect.kde.org/][kdeconnect]] I have to answer if the device is trusted or not.
** Answer 8
Which layer handles logical addressing?
#+begin_quote
3
#+end_quote
The Data Link (2) handle the physical addrressing while the Network (3) layer handle the logical addressing.
** Answer 9
When sending data over TCP, what would you call the "bite-sized" pieces of data?
#+begin_quote
segments
#+end_quote
I don't know why but I got confused with the name of the data at this point, which is packets.
** Answer 10
[Research] Which layer would the FTP protocol communicate with?
#+begin_quote
7
#+end_quote
I didn't research that, I just thinked that if TCP is an application, like ssh or a web server, it must communicate with the Application Layer.
** Answer 11
Which transport layer protocol would be best suited to transmit a live video?
#+begin_quote
UDP
#+end_quote
* Encapsulation (This is a core part)
As the data is passed down each layer of the model, more information containing details specific to the layer in question is added on to the start of transmission.
** Example
The header added by the Network Layer would include things like the source and destination IP addresses, and the header added by the Transport Layer would include (amongst the other things) information specific to the protocol being used.
The data link layer also adds a piece on at the end of the transmission, which is used to verify thath the data has not been corrupted on transmission, which is used to verify thath the data has not been corrupted on transmission; this is also has the added bonus of increased security, as the data can't be intercepted and tampered with without breaking the trailer.
This whole process is referred to as encapsulation; the process by which data can be sent from one computer to another.
Pay attention on the name of Data in the different layer.
#+CAPTION: OSI Encapsulation
[[~/Documents/Org/assets/TryHackMe/iso-encapsulation-example.jpeg]]
When the message is received by the second computer, it reverse the process -- starting at the physical layer and working up until it reaches the application layer, stripping off the added information as it goes.
This is referred as _de-encapsulation_.
As such you can think of the layers of the OSI model as existing inside every computer with network capabilities.
Whilst it's not actually as clear cut in practice, computers all follow the same process of encapsulation to send data and de-encapsulation upon receiving it.
The processes of encapsulation and de-encapsulation are very important -- not least because of their practical use, but also because they give us a standardised method for sending data. This means that all transmissions will consistently follow the same methodology, allowing any network enabled device to send a request to any other reachable device and be sure that it will be understood -- regardless of whether they are from the same manufacturer; use the same operating system; or any other factors.
*** NOTE
This section is equal, in every word, to the lection on TryHackMe, I didn't find a place where I can strip some word/sentence without leaving information, and also is very condensed.

* The TCP/IP Model
Is very similar, yet different, to the OSI model, serves as the basis for real-world networking.
The TCP/IP model consist of four layers (defined in RFC1122):
1. Network Interface
2. Internet
3. Transport
4. Application

Between this four layer TCP/IP cover the same range of functions as the seven layers of the OSI Model.
The TCP/IP model have also another definition, consisting of five layers (not defined in any RFC):

1. Physical Layer
2. Data Link
3. Internet
4. Transport
5. Application

** Comparison between OSI and TCP/IP
[[~/Documents/Org/assets/TryHackMe/OSI-TCPIP-comparison.png]]
The process of encapsulation and de-encapsulation work in exactly the same way.
** Three Way Handshake
The TCP/IP stack is composed by multiple protocol, the most important are the one who gives the name:
+ TCP, controls the flow of data between two endpoints
+ IP, controls how packets are addressed and sent
The TCP/IP is a connection based protocol, that means that before you are allowed to send data through TCP, you must enstablish a stable connection, this is done with the _three way handshake_.
*** Steps
1. Client, send a SYN request
2. Server, respond with SYN/ACK response
3. Client, send an ACK response
