* <2022-09-09 Fri> Starting journey
Starting learning path on [[https://tryhackme.com/paths][tryhackme]].
I've already started the learning path a year ago, but I'm not happy with the way I studied from it, so I'm starting from the beginning.
** What I will use
+ Emacs
+ Kali linux (maybe in the future I will try something else, see [[https://blackarch.org/][blackarch]], [[https://www.parrotsec.org][parrot]])
+ Denote, as a logbook and notetaking
